nodes with 6597 edges. The initial step involves application of force atlas algorithm on the network. 
The project contains all related properties with respect to the network including betweenness 
centrality , average path length etc. The network has been modular using modular classes and partitioning 
colours to different module classes. The graph has also been made aesthetic by adjusting size of the 
nodes with respect to degree.
